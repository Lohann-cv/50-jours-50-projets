2025-10-24 17:15:04,CritTech 02  Indias Growth Spurt  tldr nirfed," Overview

ASPI in 2023 shook global strategic circles with a report on China dominating 57 out of 64 critical technologies contributing a whopping 39 of all quality research While the Anglosphere 22 and Europe 16 could challenge this dominance as blocs as an individual nation only the US 15 comes close to China India comes 3rd at 5

In my previous post I discussed how India ranks 3rd globally in both quantity and quality in recent years 4th in consistency and 5th historically 21 years in quality research Apart from a need to improve the quality to quantity ratio these results reveal Indias sudden emergence in the global science and technology stage In this post I try to understand Indias growth spurt discussing only the contributions in quality research ie top10 research by citation count We are not looking at consistency ie hindex tough to track over years or raw quantity

Post 00 About the Series

Post 01 Indias Standing

ASPIs Interactive TechTracker Website

Data This post is based on data from Australian Strategic Policy Institute ASPI who have since 2023 maintained a database about scientific research in certain critical strategic technologies They measure which country contributed how much to the top research in each technology 12 Their work is free to view at the website 3 A large portion of this post also uses data from the report RD Statistics at a Glance 202223 by the NSTMIS which is a Government of India Department of Science  Technology arm that tracks RD related statistics in India 14 The India data is compared to data from several G20 countries obtained from the OECD 43 and the United Nations 47 48

 Historical Contributions by Region 2003  2023

Figure 2A Historical contributions to top1037 highly cited research in 64 critical technologies by region Percentage contribution to each technology first calculated and then averaged Data from  For more on methodology read the ASPI reports linked in my Post 00  i Top Yearly shares by region ii Bottom Cumulative shares by region starting from 2003 Regions top to bottom SubSaharan Africa thin green West Asia North Africa red South America yellow Oceania thin cyan Eurosphere Eurasia lighter blue South Asia dark gold India South East Asia yellow East Asia China Anglosphere 

Chinas dominance today is a story of 20 years of consistent linear growth at the expense of a similar linear decline in the Anglospheres contribution led by the US since about 2004 The Eurosphere  East Asia have similarly lost ground since 200910 and West Asia  South East Asia have picked up some of this slack around the same time But unmistakably China has been the biggest winner Again unmistakably the second biggest winner has been India starting much later around 2016

Despite the global Norths recent backsliding in its share of global research their historical contribution can still have longlasting effects Patents take 20 years to expire for instance Going from lab to industry is a long process in most technologies and their effects are plain to see in the continued industrial dominance of Western companies in several strategic sectors China having now secured a competitive spot even in terms of cumulative historical research contribution can be expected to have achieved similar competitiveness in many strategic industries As many strategic analysts point out it does

The global North has dropped the ball on research The Anglosphere  East Asia have surrendered a third of their research potential to effectively facilitate Chinas rise The Eurosphere also let go of a fifth of its cumulative research power so to speak India West Asia  South East Asia took on some of the responsibility since 2010

Indias share was a quarter of Chinas even in 2003 But while China rose consistently for a whole 20 years India only picked up its pace in the recent past The next figure makes this more clear One last note West Asia started off better than India but hasnt caught up to Indias recent rapid rise Neither has South East Asia largely led by Singapore been able to expand on its gains to be competitive with India Indias rise if consistent could mimic Chinas in its rapidity and potentially capture a large chunk of global share in research

 Yearly Contributions by Country 2003  2023

Figure 2B Yearly contributions to top1037 highly cited research in 64 critical technologies by country during the 2003  2023 period These 9 countries are the only ones who have been in the top 5 during this period Percentage contribution per technology is calculated then averaged across technologies Data from  i Top As described ii Bottom Same but in log scale

The two graphs above show the same data In the first figure the US  China dominate and all other countries contributions are barely noticeable The second figure is in logarithmic scale so we can visualise the other countries progress

China  the US have an absolute command over global science As the US continues to cede space to China research from Japan  France continue to decline rapidly The UK resisted the decline till around Brexit in 2020 The German growth story reversed in 2010 and Italys around 2014 but Italy maintained far more ground than other declining countries in this list South Korea is the only developed country here to maintain positive growth

Indias story is the most different from the bunch India has always made a somewhat bumpy upward progress in its share of global research Since 2019 the progress has been in a consistent upward trajectory Depending upon how you choose to smooth out the rough bumps you might even notice the trajectory beginning a few years earlier around 2010

 Yearly Gross Domestic Product 2003  2023

Figure 2C Yearly share in global gross domestic product GDP current prices by country during the 2003  2023 period in log scale for the countries in Figure 2B Data from the UN Statistics Division

One might think that a countrys research output is proportional to its share of global GDP The figure above gives the global share of GDP by country for the top 9 countries in highly cited research in the 64 critical technologies 

The relationship between GDP and a countrys critical technologies research output is rather unclear and varies with the country For some there is some correlation even if not strong An increase in Chinas share of global GDP coincides with an increased share of highly cited research a reduced share in GDP for Japans  Frances coincides with reduced research output For Germany Italy  the UK the decline in research starts about 10 years after their GDP share starts to decline

The US South Korea  India are unusual cases USAs share in global GDP stays static even as its critical technologies research output reduces South Koreas share of global GDP in 2023 is roughly the same as 2003 but it has made gains in research not as dramatic as China or India Indias rise in share of critical technology research oddly happens more consistently around the time when its growth in share of global GDP plateaus

So GDP alone does not explain research output Particularly Indias

 Yearly RD Investment by Country 2003  2023

Figure 2D Yearly gross expenditure in research and development GERD by country during 2003  2023 as a percentage share of i Global GDP that year log scale ii National GDP that year for the countries in Figure 2B Data from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics and UN Statistics Division

Different countries could be spending different amounts on research ie they have different Gross Expenditure in Research and Development or GERD This is tracked by countries as part of the sustainable development goals set by the UN SDG 95 In the figures above GERD is represented as a percentage of either the global GDP or national GDP for a given year I will be using the abbreviation GERDN as a shorthand for GERD as a percentage of national GDP GERDN is a decent indicator of how much an individual country prioritises research over other expenses Data is from United Nations agencies 47 48

These graphs with Figure 2B and 2C describe a complicated story and I will take you through it bit by bit starting with the declining powers

The United States has plateaued in its share of global GDP This coincides with a dramatic loss in its share of global highly cited research each year ceding space to China A recent increase in RD funding has halted the rapid decline But it remains a mystery how despite having nearconstant GERDN from 2003 to 2020 the USA steadily lost ground to China

This is similar to Germanys mysterious decline in share of critical technology research despite using steadily increased GERDN to make up for its steadily declining global GDP share France is equally odd Unlike Germany Frances increase in GERDN has not kept up with the decline in global GDP share Even so the absolute descent in its share of global research is far too dramatic to be explained simply by a reduced share in global GERD 

In these 3 cases the USGermany  France additional government or industry policies must have led to their diminished share of research Their research decline looks worse than their funding would suggest I wont try to figure out why that is the case because citizens of these countries are better equipped to do that My gut says that this has something to do with outsourcing research to China but I have no solid citations on the matter

The UK similar to the US halted its decline in research outcomes with major increases in RD funding despite a downward tumbling GDP share that would have otherwise dragged down its share in global research even further The recent rapid drop coincided with Brexit but I will leave British scholars to figure out the link

Japan has had the most precipitous decline in global GDP share Despite irregular increases in its GERDN the decline in GDP has dragged down its share in research Italy is similar  their steadily increasing GERDN could not make up for the far more rapid decline in GDP 

China more than doubled its GERDN over 21 years and along with a dramatic increase in GDP it makes sense how it has come to dominate global research South Korea also doubled their GERDN but with stagnant GDP share their share in global research has only seen moderate but steady progress

In all four cases Japan Italy China  South Korea research funding alone can quite easily explain the observed research outcomes No mystery here

Indias growth spurt is exceptional With relatively poor GERDN and twiceplateaued GDP how India managed to accelerate its research progress is unclear As with the US Germany  France if funding cant explain the oddity it must be some government  industry policies

 Government of India Programs and Policies

Very few policies or initiatives in GoIs Department of Science  Technology DST website seem to begin around when Indias scientific output accelerated ie first in 2010 and then 2019 A list of all programs is in Post 00 There are two I would like to highlight in particular because they coincide with Indias accelerated rise

The PURSE Program

The PURSE Promotion of University Research and Scientific Excellence program started in 2009 33 with the objective of promoting toptier research in universities But why was this program even needed Isnt that the whole point of GoIs RD budget Well no

Typically scientific research at universities is funded through government grants private or industry grants arent as common no citations These government grants are funnelled through certain scientific agencies under the government These scientific agencies make up less than 40 of the governments GERD and not all of it goes out as grants So how much funding do universities actually get It is difficult to tell A rough estimate adding up the RD funding going to ICAR DST CSIR and DBT stands at about 13 of Indias total GERD Where does the rest of the money go You will have to wait for the next post for that

Having more avenues for funding research makes sense in this context and PURSE was designed specifically to promote high quality research in domains of national priority PURSE explicitly excludes academic institutes such as IISc IITs IISERs NITs etc since they already had an active research culture and so had easier access to funds from the scientific agencies like DST DBT etc As a rule of thumb universities with a University in their name were eligible for PURSE funding PURSE helped many universities improve their research outcomes  quality publications during and even after their PURSE funding concluded 33

But PURSE is a small initiative If my math is right the total peryear expenditure in PURSE Phase IA  IB was 03 of Indias 201011 GERD Its impact is difficult to judge since the ASPI data does not have enough details on the historical research trajectory of all individual Indian institutes in their data However one thing could be noted since 2010  Indias research trajectory began to steadily take on exponential growth Figure 2B Whether it was PURSE or some general trend of prioritising research there was some visible impact

On a separate note this may be partly why the Anusandhan National Research Foundation NRF was announced with the National Education Policy NEP in 2020 40  to give more avenues for grants NRF was constituted only in February 2024 with a first year budget of 2000 crores For context Indias total GERD in 202021 was about 127000 crores which means that NRF got at most 16 of Indias GERD If I am not wrong the 202526 budget documents reveal that only 200 crores out of the budgeted 2000 crores were spent 39 You can put that down under teething troubles but this is not an auspicious start A budget of 1950 crores has been allocated for 202526 Hope we spend it this time

NIRF When short on carrots

The biggest growth spurt in Indias research started in 2019 And the hero here or the culprit is the National Institutional Ranking Framework or NIRF NIRF was announced in 2015 with the purpose of ranking universities institutes and colleges all over India 36 As a ranking provided by the government this has an enormous impact on which colleges are considered the best for prospective students in Indias higher education system

Why does NIRF matter Because for the first time ever universities  colleges in India were going to be scored on their research outcomes 36 as part of a government ranking for institutes NIRF had announced that for the Overall rankings it would give 40 weightage to research outcomes Out of the 40 4 was reserved for patents The remaining 36 was split evenly between i a percentile score for number of publications per faculty and ii the total number of citations per publication which for some reason was again multiplied with percentile in subscore i So now 36 of what determines your colleges ranking reputation enrollment and probably most importantly tuition fees you can claim from the richer but less meritorious applicants is now governed by research outcomes Yuck

Believe it or not the weightage for research is no longer 40 now It was set to 30 in 2019 37 Which honestly I am surprised hasnt been dragged lower by incessant lobbying Honestly considering the backlash NIRF gets I applaud GoI for standing its ground at 30

Very few institutes research trajectories have been presented in the ASPI data 3 Among the 21 trajectories that were not an IIT IISc NIT or a GoI scientific institute 19 showed a noticeable increase in research output after 2016 The only exception was Anna University which for some unknown reason actually cared for research before NIRF Details in Post 00

So I can confidently say that most institutes in India especially private institutions of higher education only took interest in research after NIRF rankings started to affect their reputation and thus bottomlines I am not the first to notice the huge impact that NIRF has had on Indias publication and citation numbers A careful analysis by some scholars shows how state universities have been slipping while NITs  deemed universities have risen in their research outcomes 38 The good news here is that neither have shaken the IITs from their top position despite the competition having considerably heated up in recent years

Taking Goodhart to heart

In my previous post Post 01 I had figures showing how India has ranked highly in ASPIs rankings for publications in terms of raw numbers and citation counts Note that these are the metrics NIRF is also measuring The main difference being that ASPI measures for each technology separately which makes more sense since some domains naturally have high publication rates and others have low But India lagged behind on hindex according to ASPI a metric that NIRF is not measuring Naturally there have been calls for adding an hindex metric to the NIRF rankings under the belief that what is measured will be improved But will it help 

There is also the problem that the NIRF ranking equates one citation on a food habits survey paper with one citation in a thorium salt reactor design improvements Expertise in niche technological domains is not rewarded by NIRF Research domains where it is easier to publish eg if they do not require high capital expenditure on scientific instruments will be unduly rewarded while harder slower research is ignored because of low citation count Better qualified scientists have suggested more improvements to NIRF but will it help

As there has been a surge of publications in recent years and a soaring citation count there have been widespread reports on scientific malpractice in India Proliferation of casual papers with no serious science to increase publication numbers and colleges forcing their faculty to cite each others papers to increase citation counts A paper on fruit and vegetable consumption published by students and faculty from one university for instance had cited a study on diesel engines by others in the same university Paper mills and unethical low quality payandpublish journals abound 41 

These complaints dont even touch the social problems created by gamifying research like the exploitation of students a nationwide loss of integrity and the consequent issues this may cause for the reputation of meritorious researchers from our country

The government noticed how widespread the problem is and decided to modify NIRF to now give negative marks for universities with paper retractions and other research malpractice Over the past two to three years many institutes have seen a significant number of research papers retracted raising concerns about their credibility Experts say that unless negative marks are introduced institutes are unlikely to take corrective action 42 Whether this will improve academic integrity or instate a not on paper corruption it is hard to say

This chain of events is something you might expect when the gamification of quantitative metrics requires colleges to produce more research output without a concomitant increase in GERDN As good old Goodheart once said whenever a government seeks to rely on a previously observed statistical regularity for control purposes that regularity will collapse What you measure you corrupt

On the positive side even if the metrics have been gamified and perverted this has created a culture of research in India that did not previously exist at this scale You can see how the IITs have pushed themselves harder because of this competition 38 although it may also be that they have joined in on the corruption While it is hard to envisage a metric that cannot be corrupted by Goodhearts law truly valuable research can change the landscape of Indias public and private sector industry 

 Opinion

A general malaise has taken over Indias university system with little investment to upgrade even the normal civic infrastructure let alone the unimaginable capital expenses you need to purchase state of the art scientific equipment An academician faces a whole lot of byzantine bureaucracy even when funding is secure This environment creates sequestered scientists whose work becomes more removed from industrial applications These are some of the issues JNU Professor Binay Panda mentions in his critique of the ANRF 49 Please give it a read Some of his other points probably no longer apply after the recent RDI scheme announcement so keep that in mind

The atrophied research skills in Indian institutions is now being highlighted by the postNIRF scandals of academic malpractice 41 42 The fact that universities in themselves should be a place to conduct research not just get degrees has disappeared from our consciousness The longer this marital separation of higher education from research prolongs the more perilous our path to progress

 Conclusion

For countries like China Japan South Korea and Italy RD expenditure trends track with the countrys research output in critical technologies For some like the US UK France and Germany their share of global critical technology research actually is less than what their funding should suggest And for India the biggest oddball of the bunch we see a growth spurt despite a practically stagnant share in global RD expenditure All thanks to NIRF

While NIRF has definitely shaken up Indias higher education sector forcing it to relearn the lost art of research it is not clear if there is any more juice you can squeeze out of this lemon before things get too bitter There is only so far you can push scientists to publish papers without any uptick in the shameful 065 of our GDP that we spend on GERD Academic malpractice has already become far too common

Nonetheless even though it is not sustainable in the long run this approach of naming and shaming universities for their research performance has allowed India to consistently up its game both in the raw number of papers as well as the quality of these papers Now that the higher education sector has been spurred into action it is time for there to be an enormous increase in the RD expenditure 1 of GDP is a bare minimum

2025-10-24 17:02:03, Froggy vs Carolina series turns 10 years old,"On October 24th exactly ten years ago what initially seemed like an absurd and ridiculous small spinoff of the Five Nights with Froggy series was created Since then this spinoff has evolved into a fascinating duology consisting of simple yet engaging jumps away from flying knives and a grand battle in an arena where guest characters along with a host of new faces crossed paths

Although the FvC universe isnt currently receiving new updates or active development like for instance Mystery Chamber it still remains one of the most successful thanks to the sequel which many still consider one of the best games by GKProduction

Someday the Froggy vs Carolina game series will once again capture attention You will witness many more knives epic battles characters and so much more because the potential here is limitless Perhaps that time is closer than you think In any case you can all look forward to major royal chaos heated duels and much more in the future Happy 10th anniversary",GKProduction,https://i.redd.it/f9e45klec3xf1.png,1,en

2025-10-24 16:38:12,I think I could cry,"I made a post maybe a week ago on the same topic but I just wanted to update how Im doing

I finally feel like I have my SIBO under control I was diagnosed with methane overgrowth a month ago but Ive been exhibiting symptoms for two years Two years ago my doctor wanted me to do the SIBO test but for some reason never ordered it and I never followed up because going gluten free fixed all my issues at least for a year because my symptoms came back summer 2024 I just assumed the sudden anxiety I developed was causing all the GI symptoms I think its the opposite now I think my SIBO worsened I also started to exhibit signs of malabsorption I believe now the malabsorption was likely contributing to the severe anxiety that literally came out of no where Anyways Im feeling a lot more normal now and it feels amazing 

For those wondering Ive been basically making my own ginger turmeric shots using green juice or an electrolyte drink Ive read ginger and turmeric can help stimulate digestion so I take the shot generally in the morning before eating and at night before dinner Sometimes I will take it after I eat if I forget to do it before I havent noticed any differences doing it either way Im also still glutenfree Maybe sometime down the road Ill try gluten again but for now Im sticking to it 

Anyways this is the most normal Ive felt in while I have more energy bloating is gone abdominal discomfort is gone no more gas my stress anxiety has lowered and Im back to having normal BMs once a day I could literally cry

One more thing before I finish the post I never received my SIBO data so I dont know what my numbers are All I know is that I registered greater than 10 My doctor prescribed those usual scary antibiotics but I decided to try the natural route first especially since I appear based off of my symptoms that I likely have a more mild to sometimes moderate case I occasionally had really bad flare ups like these past two months Literally the day after taking my first ginger turmeric shot my symptoms practically went away Ive never been someone who likes the taste of ginger and turmeric but Im sucking it up because it makes me feel better I have trouble swallowing pills which is why Im doing the powder instead of capsules

I hope everyone will be able to find what works for them and will start feeling better soon  Here are links to everything Im using Just because this worked for me does not mean it will work for you I just felt like sharing

I had seen vids on YT about the latin and Bonaparte paths but not the Pan Europe path On one hand its nice that we have this path and it was better than vanilla EU paths 

But on the other it was extremely easy to make countries submit to you and if they dont you dont get a war goal which would be ideal and also more fun Also there was some mod related glitches Romania being the head of the Minsk accords after the soviets got defeated Albania being a puppet of a non existent Italy no decision to annex Holland who left the faction mid war ect There was also not really many events Some parts just felt like map painting You also got a ungodly amount of troops every time you annexed a nation

2025-10-24 16:13:53,Tenorio Skipjack Tuna with Sundried Tomatoes and Basil,"Another solid selection from Tenorio  The tender tuna steaks are in a slurry of sundried tomatoes and basil both good strong flavors  Only a small handful of other canned seafood options with sundried tomatoes in the mix  

Not that the Tapatio blast of the cupospuds is all that fiery but the flavors marshaled by the tin more than stood up for themselves  Instant mashed are always a bit weird I know  The cupboard at me work was otherwise bare so one makes do doesnt one ",Tinnedfish,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1of1zjn,3,en

Whats interesting is that I wasnt able to find the flow throughout the program and thats actually what I work on the most having a consistent feeling on the ice Yet in the moment when it mattered it somehow felt disconnected from what Ive been training I had decent practices I actually felt really good so its a bit disappointing not to find the thing I was focusing on the most

At the same time Im happy to be here because it anchors the start of my season You have to start somewhere its not perfect but its the beginning Everyone else has already done three or more competitions and Im just arriving like hello here I am not yet rocking like a hurricane

On being alone in the Kiss  Cry

Before the first day of practice I received an envelope from fans full of kind messages and notes of encouragement One of them said Even though you came alone youre never alone And honestly I didnt feel lonely at all

On performing this program for the first time

It felt overwhelmingly positive because this program has a very deep meaning for me The costume arrived only two weeks ago and skating in it felt special like everything finally got shape I chose the color myself its more of a Bordeaux tone It represents passion and its also very Latvian

On his coaching situation

As Ive said before I focus on my performance The rest will make sense down the line For now Ill refrain from any comment on the situation Im still based in Switzerland and training there

On his free skate

I do plan to debut my new James Bond program one day but since I dont feel comfortable skating to something thats not fully approved under the new music rights rules I decided to return for now to my free skate from last season

Message to his fans

Actually nothing really changes my passion is only getting amplified I want to do more express more explore more So come along for the ride Ill do my best I cant guarantee outcomes or success but I can guarantee Im working harder than ever I have passion I have fire inside me and a lot of pride

2025-10-24 16:00:02,Safe car set setup,"Hi everyone we are nearing the arrival of our DiDi twins Just a few weeks left to go We currently only have one car which is a small Toyota Yaris IA sedan We have a 3 year old son that typically rides in the middle of the back seat We were gifted a couple of newborn car seats from a state organization that helps families in need I cant remember all of the makes or models of car seats at the moment 

Any ideas on how to set all three seats up in our small car that would keep everyone safe 

We thought about keeping the toddler in the middle and each newborn on the sides but just not sure how safe that is and not sure if they will fit as comfortably as they can any other way

We do plan to upgrade to a minivan next year we would still be doing a 3 seats across setup in the minivan but I understand there will be more wiggle room in the van when that time comes 

Edit toddler is in a Cosco easy elite slim allinone and the newborn seats are Baby Trend EZLift 30 pro",parentsofmultiples,https://www.reddit.com/r/parentsofmultiples/comments/1of1mbf/safe_car_set_setup/,1,en

2025-10-24 15:55:25,They should ban these people,"They should ban these players This guy started playing defensively from the 45th minute of the second half after scoring a goal until the 85th minute just passing the ball from one side to the other so I couldnt steal it He hid behind his goal and did nothing else I had to change my formation put 4 forwards use quick counter and push 2 attacking bars just to finally steal the ball and tie the game Then in extra time he scored another goal and did the same thing again

You cant play and enjoy the game like that they should ban him or demote him for doing this Ive already reported him and Im sharing his username so everyone else can report him too These kinds of players are disgusting

Its one thing to play calmly and build up from the back but its another thing to just hide behind your goal for the entire second half",eFootballgame,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1of1hzh,0,en

My FotD is earthbended and equipped with blade of selves  
I attack with it I create 3x2 copies of it It creates  2x234567  zombies 40 zombies

Edit 2x2 copies  2x2345  28 zombies

Edit 2x2 simultaneous  4 x 5 x 2 4 times there is 5 FotD triggers that creates 2 zombies  40 zombies

Let say the original FotD has not been destructed  
End of combat  
6 copies of FotD are exiled But As it was copies of an earthbended creature its not a counter So does it comes back to the battlefield as tokens of FotD   
So a creation of 2x6 FotD tokens that will generate 2x23456789101112  130 zombies

Edit 2x4 tokens  2x23456789  70 zombies

Edit 0 zombies 

So Answer is 40

Edit It creates 2 copies with blade of selves not 3

Edit  Copies comes all at the same time not one by one And tokens cease to exists when leaving the field",mtg,https://i.redd.it/bl5fg6fhp2xf1.png,28,en
